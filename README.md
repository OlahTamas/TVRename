# TVRename
A small utility to rename TV show downloads to a standard format, and a way for me to learn some Java.

With TVRename you can open a folder and have it scanned for video (mkv, avi, mp4) and subtitle (srt, sub) files. 
The application can detect a variety of different season/episode naming format and will guess the series' title from the filenames.
